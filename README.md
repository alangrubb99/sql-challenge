Challenge 9
I used QuckDBD-Design  to establish initiall tables and relationships betweem them
I then exported a postgres .sql file to create the initial tables.   I had to modify the 
 PRIMARY KEY for the dept_emp table, to combine the columns since employees can have multiple departments. 
 I received no help other than querying google for syntax of Select and Table Create statements.
 I verified all SELECT statements worked in PGADMIN 4.
